* Theme?
  * StarWars (the dark side),
  * Enterprise/StarTrek?
  * Something  else

Chris's Thoughts:
Closet rubyist
J2EE programmer (who gradually sees the light)
J2EE architect (who stubbornly stays in the dark)

It breaks down nicely into the galileo format, except now there is a
more obvious solution we'll be driving at. There are so many topics we
could hit:

* Struts vs Rails (complex code melts away as you move to Ruby)
* EJB vs ActiveResource
* Deployment cycle times vs refresh the page and see changes
* Testing
* Huge ant files vs Rake (I like this one -- jim)

Other ideas:
* Astronaut Architects
* Committee Decisions
* XML Situps
* JRuby integration
