* Theme?
  * StarWars (the dark side),
  * Enterprise/StarTrek?
  * Something  else

Chris's Thoughts:
Closet rubyist
J2EE programmer (who gradually sees the light)
J2EE architect (who stubbornly stays in the dark)

It breaks down nicely into the galileo format, except now there is a
more obvious solution we'll be driving at. There are so many topics we
could hit:

Struts vs Rails (complex code melts away as you move to Ruby)
EJB vs ActiveResource
Deployment cycle times vs refresh the page and see changes
Testing
Huge ant files vs Rake (I like this one -- jim)

Other ideas:
* Astronaut Architects
* Committee Decisions
* XML Situps
* JRuby integration
