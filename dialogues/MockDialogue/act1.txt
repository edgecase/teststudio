Mock Dialogue
By Jim Weirich and Joe O'brien

Act I

[The scene opens with an obviously agitated Joe on the phone]

Joe: Yes, I'd like to speak to desktop services.  Yes, I'll hold.  

[Short pause]

Joe: Hello, desktop services? Yes, I'd like to ... Oh, my name? Joe
     O'Brien. Yes, I'd ... [interrupted] my employee number? 43215.
     [pause] My location is building 2, 2nd floor, desk ... ummm ...
     [looking around for desk number], ah, here it is, desk number
     312. [Frustrated] Look, is there anything else you need, like the
     name of my first born?

[pause]

Joe: [continuing] Ok. Here's my problem. I tried to log in this moring
     to the system and it won't accept my password. Yes, I'm sure I
     entered it correctly. Yes, I checked the shift lock key. Yes, I
     tried that too. You'll look into it? Yes, I will hold. [drums
     fingers]

[Jim enters and sits down at the neighboring workstation]

Jim: Morning Joe! Oh, sorry, I didn't see you were on the phone.

Joe: No problem, I'm talking to desktop services. I can't seem to get
     logged in this morning.

Jim: Hmm ... well, the system is working for me. I was able to get
     right in.

Joe: Great ... then the problen is mine. [talking to phone] Yes, I'm
     still here. [pause] What? My login has bee locked out? Why?
     [pause] ... Because of too many failed login attempts? That
     doesn't make sense, I've been typing my password correctly all
     along. I don't understand why [thought occurs to Joe] ... Oh
     nevermind, I got it. Can you unlock the login for me. [pause] ...
     Thanks.

Jim: So, got you fat fingered your password, huh? What did you do,
     login with the shift lock on?

Joe: You know I've remapped shift lock to be the control key, just to
     be more nimble in emacs. [wiggles fingers] No, the answer more
     complicated than that.

Jim: Oh? [turns around and looks at Joe].  Go on, I'm all ears.

Joe: Well, you know I'm working on the new single sign-on inititive
     for our web applications, right?

Jim: Sure, you and I have paired on some of that code.

Joe: Right. So yesterday I was working on the code that actually logs
     into our network. And I've been doing the whole thing test-first,
     just as you taught us. So when I came to the part of the code
     that will handle a login failure, I just wrote a test that
     provides a bad password. The login fails, and in good TDD manner,
     I'm forced to write the code that handles the failing login.

Jim: That's good work.  So what's the problem?

Joe: Well, evidently, I ran the unit tests so many times yesterday
     that the number of failed password attempts triggered an
     automatic lock out of my account.

Jim: What, you were running the unit tests agains the REAL login
     system?

Joe: Absolutely. You know they don't have a "test" login system
     available for us, and I have to test my code against something.

Jim: And you were using your real account AND real password? [shakes
     head]

Joe: Well, yes. For the good login test. Obviously it was a bad
     password for the failing login test. Awww, and now I'm going to
     have to delete those tests. I can't be calling up desktop
     services for a password reset everytime I run the unit tests.

Jim: Well, there are alternatives...

Joe: Like running it with your password instead?

Jim: No, I was thinking along the lines of a mock object.

Joe: A WHAT object?

Jim: Mock object, or stub, or test double if you prefer. There are
     several names for these things. But the basic idea is that during
     your test, you talk to an object that only "pretends" to log into
     the system. Externally it acts just like the real thing, so you
     can test against it. However, internally, it does something
     completely different.

Joe: Interesting. Will you pair with me and show me how this thing
     would work?

Jim: Sure! [moves over and joins Joe at his workstation] Show me what
     you've got.

Joe: Ok, here's the first part of the code:

   ## Snippet I-1
   class ReportPrinter
     ...
     def start(user, password)
       @token = @login_service.login(username, password)
       fail "Unable to start Report Printer" if @token.nil?
     end
     ...

Jim: Cool, so where do the login service object come from?

Joe: We create that in the initializer, like so:
     
     ## Snippet I-2
     def initialize
       @login_service = LoginService.new
     end

Jim: So, to start the report printer, you log into the system and get
     back some kind of token. What's that used for?

Joe: A security token indicates you have successfully logged into the
     system. It's just a string that identifies you as a particular
     user. It has a built in time-out, so you can only use any given
     token for so long before it expires. And, oh yeah, it is
     cryptographically signed so that you can't forge it ... one of
     those public/private key things, right?

Jim: Do you care about the value of the token in your code:

Joe: Nah, just whether it is nil or not. A nil token means that the
     login has failed. If the token is good, we just pass it back to
     the login system in later operations. For example, here's the
     code where we check to see if we have permissions to perform a
     print operation:

     ## Snippet I-3
     def print_report
       if @login_service.allowed?(@token, 'print')
         generate_report
         send_report_to_printer
       else
         fail "You are not authorized to use the printer"
       end
     end

Joe: See, we just pass the token back.  We never use its value.

Jim: Good, this will be easy. You have most of the code ready. All we
     have to do is change the initialization a bit. Here, something
     like this: [Jim starts typing]

       ## Snippet I-4
       def initialize(login_service)
         @login_service = login_service
       end

Joe: You've made the login_service a parameter to the initializer.
     Why?  That seems inconvient.

Jim: Perhaps it is a bit, but it makes your code less dependent on the
     login system. We move the responsibility for creating the login
     system out of your code and somewhere else.

Joe: I don't like it.

Jim: But now your code doesn't depend on the name "LoginService", only
     that there is an object that reponds to the LoginService
     protocol. We can give your code *any* object that acts in the
     same way and your code won't care.

Joe: Ok, that a good point [beat] ... But I still don't like it.

Jim: Fair enough. Just bear with a bit more and we can fix that later.
     But let's concentrate on the issue at hand for now.

Joe: [grudgingly] Fine.     

Jim: So, now we can write our test like this:

       # Snippet I-5
       def test_good_login
         login_service = FakeLoginService.new
         printer = ReportPrinter.new(login_service)
         printer.start("USER", "PASSWORD")
         ...
       end
         
Joe: [thinking] Oh, I think I see where this is going. Now we can
     write a dummy version of the login service. Here, [grabbing the
     keyboard] let my type.   It might look like this:

       ## Snippet I-5a
       class FakeLoginService
         def login(user, password)
           "fake_security_token"
         end
         def allow?(token)
           true
         end
       end

Jim: Good! I like the return the "fake_security_token" string. Since
     we don't care about the value of the string, might as well use
     something that describes itself for when we are debugging later.

Joe: Debugging? I thought you told me this TDD stuff eliminates
     debugging. [beat] Just kidding. So, this handles the case where
     we have a good login,  how do we handle a bad login.

Jim: Well, there are a couple of ways. One way is to make the
     FakeLoginService check the password. If you test with "PASSWORD"
     its a good login, if it anything else, you get a failed login.

       ## Snippet I-6
       class FakeLoginService
         def login(user, password)
           (password == "PASSWORD") ? "fake_security_token" : nil
         end
       end

Joe: Seems straightforward enough. And I can see adding logic to the
     allow? method to return true or false, depending on what the test
     needs at the time. [thinking] ... But I can see the logic getting
     kinda convoluted if there are a lot of different scenarios and
     you have to accommodate them all in one fake class.

Jim: Right. If you're not careful, your fake objects can become as
     complex as a real object. Then you need tests for your fakes and
     that route leads to madness.  

Joe: You mentioned other ways?  For example?     

Jim: A simple way of avoiding complex fake objects is to use specific
     fake objects for each test. We already have a fake login service
     that works with the good login test case. Now we write one for
     the failing test case. [grabbing keyboard] Like this:

       ## Snippet I-7
       class FakeLoginService
         def login(user, password)
           nil
         end
       end

Jim: With a test that looks like this:

       ## Snippet I-8
       def test_bad_login
         login_service = FakeLoginServiceWithFailingLogin.new
         printer = ReportPrinter.new(login_service)
         assert_raise LoginError do
           printer.start("USER", "PASSWORD")
         end
       end

Joe: Cool.  But you didn't write the allow? method for this fake.

Jim: allow? is never called in our test. No reason to write it since
     our fake class is tailored to that specific test.

Joe: Great.  I like this!  [beat] .... I think.

Jim: Your brow is furrowed.  What's wrong.

Joe: Well, I really do like this and all, but it seems like I'm going
     to end up writing a lot of Fake classes for all the different
     scenarios in my class.  I wish there was an easier way.

Jim: Hmmm ... what if you could customize your fake class on the fly.

Joe: Customize behaviour?  I don't get it.

Jim: Ok, let's talk in code. How about this for a fake class:

      ## Snippet I-9
      class FakeLoginService
        def new(&login_behavior)
          @login_behavior = login_behavior
        end
        def login(user, password)
          @login_behavior.call(user, password)
        end
      end

Joe: Let's see [beat]... That &login_behavior, that's a block you
     are're passing in. You give it a block when you create it?

Jim: Sure, so your good login test uses:

         # Snippet I-10
         login_service = FakeLoginService.new { "fake_security_token" }

Jim: And your bad login test uses:         

         ## Snippet I-11
         login_service = FakeLoginService.new { nil }

Jim: The fake is now logic free. The good login returns a token, the
     bad login returns nil. And best of all, you specify the behavior
     you need right in the test itself, so its clear exactly what's
     going on.
       
Joe: [excited] Gotcha! Ok, I can get used to this. And we can do the
     same thing with allow?, right? [pause, deflated]. Oh, but now we
     need to give specify a block for the allow method's behavior.
     That might be ok for two methods, but I can see this really
     getting out of hand for fakes with a number of methods.

Jim: Right.

Joe: Dang it! I'm almost tempted to write a little DSL to make
     specifying these little behaviors easier.

Jim: [grinning] I know you like DSLs ...

Joe: Yeah, this will be great! We could ... [beat]... why are you
     grinning? You know something I don't?

Jim: Actually, you might want to check RubyForge ...

Joe: Someone's done this already? ... Rats! I was all set to go off on
     a wild goose chase and you have to inject some reality here. Ok,
     what have you got.

Jim: What you need is a good mocking library. There are several
     available. I like to use flexmock.

Joe: Why that one?  How do we know it's the best one available?

Jim: Just a hunch.

Joe: Aren't we using mocks already?

Jim: Well, technically stubs, but let's not get wrapped up in
     terminology. A good mock library will provide both mocks and
     stubs, so its perfect for what we're doing here.  

Joe: Show me.

Jim: Let's look back at our good_login test.

       ## Snippet I-12
       def test_good_login
         login_service = FakeLoginService.new { "fake_security_token" }
         printer = ReportPrinter.new(login_service)
         printer.start("USER", "PASSWORD")
         ...
       end

Jim: Instead of creating the FakeLoginService, we are going to create
     a mock instead. 

       ## Snippet I-13
       def test_good_login
         login_service = flexmock('mock_service')
         ...
       end

Jim: And then we tell the mock what to expect.  

       ## Snippet I-14
       def test_good_login
        login_service = flexmock('mock_service')
        login_serivce.should_receive(:login).and_return('fake_security_token')
         ...
       end

Joe: Interesting, so if I'm reading this correctly, I'm creating an
     object on the fly and telling it what to expect? This is just
     like our last solution except I don't have to write the fake
     service class.

Jim: Exactly. Not only that the mock can do more for us. Tell me what
     would happen if login is never called in the code that we are testing.

Joe: Well, I don't know about flexmock, but in our original code it
     would just be ignored.

Jim: Right, and the same this is true with our test as it stands now;
     however, we could tell flexmock that login must be called exactly
     one time. We do it like this:

       ## Snippet I-15
       def test_good_login
        login_service = flexmock('mock_service')
        login_serivce.should_receive(:login).and_return('fake_security_token').once
         ...
       end

Jim: and now flexmock will loudly complain if login is never called.

Joe: What?  How can it complain about something _not_ being called? 

Jim: Flexmock installs a teardown method that checks all the mocks
     after every test run. If something is missing then it complains
     at that point (and quite loudly I might add).

Joe: Ok, so let me get this straight, I'm not only creating an object
     on the fly, but I'm also setting up expectations that will fail if
     they are NOT met during the test.

Jim: Yes.

Joe: Ok, let me ask you this. In the old setup I wasn't able to test
     this, but I'm wondering if maybe mocks can help us out here. I
     want to verify that the user name and password that I pass into
     the start command are the same username and password given to the
     login method. Can mocks do that?

Jim: Sure. Quite easily actually. We just tell the mock what
     parameters to expect. The with expectation works quite nicely for
     that. 

Joe: Ok, so like this:
     
      ## Snippet I-16
      def test_username_and_password_are_passed_along
        login_service = flexmock('mock_service')
        login_serivce.should_receive(:login).with('joe', 'ICEICEBABY').
          and_return('fake_security_token').once
        printer = ReportPrinter.new(login_service)
        printer.start("joe", "ICEICEBABY")
         ...        
      end    

Jim: Well, yes, except you don't need to keep using your own password.
     How about something like this:

      ## Snippet I-17
      def test_username_and_password_are_passed_along
        username, password = 'username', 'password'
        login_service = flexmock('mock_service')
        login_serivce.should_receive(:login).with(username, password).
          and_return('fake_security_token').once
        printer = ReportPrinter.new(login_service)
        printer.start(username, password)
         ...        
      end    

Joe: I love the way you can just tack on more options as I need them

Jim: That's what we call a fluent interface.  

Joe: What else can a mock do? Can it handle things like throwing
     exceptions so I can test exception handling logic?

Jim: Sure, you can throw exceptions, you can specify ranges for
     numbers of times it executes, you can specify logic in the form of a
     block. Just about anything you can think of you can do in a mock. 

Joe: Wow, mocks are great.  Why didn't you just tell me about them from the beginning.  

Jim: A lot of people think the mocks are magic, only used by advanced
     programmers. I just wanted to you to realize that mocks are
     simple extension to basic test techniques. Much like the
     fundametals of arithmetic:

Joe: Oh, you mean Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.

Jim: Um ... yeah, right.
