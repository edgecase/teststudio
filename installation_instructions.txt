1) Install Ruby, Rails, and SQLite3
------------------------------------------------------
Each computer will need to have a working version of Ruby 1.9.2, Rails 3.0.0, and a Rails-supported database server (such as SQLite3) installed. They'll also need an editor in which they can comfortably write code. 

2) Install Required RubyGems
------------------------------------------------------
During the course, they'll need a number of testing-related RubyGems. If you do not have recent version of bundler (e.g. 1.0.0 or later), then install bundler with the following command.

   gem install bundler

Then download the file: http://onestepback.org/download/Gemfile-zvrs

Moved the downloaded file into an empty directory and rename it to "Gemfile".  Then run the command:

  bundle install

Bundler will take care of downloading all the required gems for the studio.

If for some reason bundler is not working, you can always install the gems individually by hand.  Use the downloaded Gemfile as a reference to find the gem name and version, then run the gem install command.  For example, the Gemfile calls out factory-girl, version 1.3.2.  To install factory-girl by hand, use the command:

  gem install factory-girl -v1.3.2
