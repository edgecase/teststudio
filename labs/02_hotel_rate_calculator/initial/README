Write a hotel rate calculator object with the following methods

  class RateCalculator
    def initialize(rake_rate=100) ... end
    def rate(check_in_date, check_out_date, number_of_rooms) ... end
  end

The rate should be calculated according the the following rules
  
* The daily rate for a room is its rack_rate minus the daily discount.
* The rate for a range of dates is the sum of the individual daily rates.
* Dates during the week get a 10% discount off of the rack rate. 
* Dates on weekends get a 20% discount off of the rack rate.

If you get done with the above, add the following extra credit rules:

* 10-49 rooms get an extra 20% off the rack_rate.
* 50+ rooms get an extra 30% off the rack_rate.
* At no time should the combined discount exceed 40%.
