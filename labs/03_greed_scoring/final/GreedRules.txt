GREED RULES

Greed is a dice game for two or more players using 5 six-sided dice

* Each player takes a turn consisting of several rolls
* The player decides whether to roll again, or not
* Each turn is scored and the points are added to the player's total score.

Scoring rules:

* A triplet of any number is worth 100 * that number
* Except a triplet of ones, which are worth 1000 points
* Single "ones" are worth 100 points
* Single "fives" are worth 50 points
* All other values do not contribute points to the roll.

Turn Rules:

* If a roll scored points, those points are added to the turns points,
  and the player may roll again with any non-scoring dice.

* If all dice have scored, then the player may roll again with all 
  five of the dice.

* If a roll does not score any points, then the player loses his turn
  and loses any points from that turn.  This is called going "bust".

* If a player elects to stop rolling before going bust, the points
  accumulated in this turn are added to his total score.

* A player must roll at least 300 in a single turn before he is
  allowed to start accumulating points.
