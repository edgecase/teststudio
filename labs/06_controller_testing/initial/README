LAB 6: Controller Testing

1. Add a "by_rank" class method (or scope if you prefer) to the Member
   model that returns the members in order of descending rank.

2. Write the specs for the Members controller.

   * Assume the standard Restful/CRUD operations
   * Make sure that the index is ordered by descending rank
   * Use either the Mock approach or the database approach

Remember to always write your test first!
