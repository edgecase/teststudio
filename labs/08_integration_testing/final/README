LAB 8: Integration Testing
--------------------------

Goal: Add a "Record Game" page to allow member to record wins/loses.

Steps:

(1) Write a high level test for the record game feature.  Use either
    RSpec or Cucumber (with webrat) to define the steps.  The scenario
    should be something like:

      * Go to the add game page
      * Select the winner and loser from a drop down list
      * Press the record button
      * See that the ranks are properly adjusted.

(2) Add a "Game" resource.  We're not going to bother making the Game
    model persistent, it just needs to call the proper wins_against
    and loses_against methods on the member objects.

(3) Implement the GamesController.  You will only need the new and
    create actions on this controller.  Use TDD with a controller spec
    to drive the implementation.  (if you have time, make sure you
    deal with error conditions, e.g. missing winner or loser, winner
    the same as loser).

(4) Revisit your integration test and make sure that it passes. Adjust
    the test or code as necessary to get everything working.
