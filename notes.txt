TODO:
* Break model testing into
  (1) Business logic testing, and
  (2) Finder testing
  And downplay the metaprogramming
* Add slides for RSpec/before(:each), etc
* Change ring example to nested context rather than shared behavior.
* Add a section javascript testing

FIXED:
* Add lab numbers to slides
* Lab has meaning of availability backwards
